  <div style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">
    <p>On my knees, I held you, as you slowly slipped away from me. I tried so hard. I ripped the infected oxygen from
      your lungs and replaced it with pure air as it swirled around your head, but the darkness that was enveloping your
      body still crept up your legs. I didn’t know what to do, I looked around maniacally for help, everyone else was
      dead
      or dying, and Arthfael knelt next to Susan, his head resting on her chest. We had led them to this fate.
      Tears started to well up in my eyes and streamed down my face as it hit me. I stopped the swirling cyclone around
      your head, and embraced you as tight as I could, and broke down. It was useless. You lifted your hand and rested
      it
      on my cheek, and I placed my hand on top of yours, holding it there.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-style: italic;"> I remembered the day Arthfael and I walked into the bar you worked. I never saw
      anything like it, and I never saw anything like you.
      I was instantly enamoured; “What’s your name?” <br>
      You looked at me with piercing, yet confident eyes, “Tifa, and yours?” <br>
      “Zee.”</p>
    <br>
    <p>I placed my other hand on your neck feeling for a pulse, it was almost nonexistent. I found something to fight
      for, to protect and come home to. Someone to keep me from truly becoming a demon. As your breathing became more
      laboured, what would stop that from happening now? In that moment, I was completely and utterly terrified of who I
      would become.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">“Tifa, if you could be doing anything else right now, what would you be doing?” <br>
      You pondered the question for a moment, brushing your dark walnut hair from your eyes; “Wandering.” <br>
      I smiled and knew you were destined for me: “Wandering, huh?” <br>
      You returned the smile, and rested your head against the palm of your hand, “Yeah, but that doesn’t pay the
      bills.” <br>
      “I see.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>You spoke one last time, it sounded like it caused you an immeasurable amount of pain; “In our next life, we’ll
      spend eternity together.”
      I assured you., “I will walk a thousand years across the dark to find you.”
      I heard the footsteps of the Wolf walking away.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Soon, you were buried next to the people who were our closest allies. Arthfael placed a hand on my shoulder and I
      leaned my head against the shovel I held in front of me.
      “Let’s get our things from camp, and get out of here.”
      I couldn’t speak, I don’t know how Arthfael could. He was stronger than I in many ways.</p>
    <br>
    <p>We settled in our boat as I sat across from Arthfael who manned the engine, as we left the island of No behind.
      He looked at me with his cold, dead eyes.
      “You alright?”
      I returned the stare, “Yeah.”
